*A Scalable Response Prediction Platform For Online Advertising.*

###Features
`TARE`(Targeted Advertising and Recommender Engine) is a hybrid engine including both `Hadoop` and `SF1R`.
`LASER` is the offline part of `TARE` running on `Hadoop`, for online part, you could access [SF1R part](http://github.com/izenecloud/sf1r-ad-delivery). The name of `LASER` comes from the publication of 
`LASER-A Scalable Response Prediction Platform For Online Advertising` and we had made some adjustments such 
that it could be tailored for product recommendation.
